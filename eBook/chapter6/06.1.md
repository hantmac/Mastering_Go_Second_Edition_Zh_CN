# 关于Go package

Everything in Go is delivered in the form of packages. A Go package is a Go source file that begins with the package keyword followed by the name of the package. Some packages
have a structure. For example, the net package has several subdirectories, named http,
mail, rpc, smtp, textproto, and url, which should be imported as net/http, net/mail,
net/rpc, net/smtp, net/textproto, and net/url, respectively.

Apart from the packages of the Go standard library, there exist external packages that can
be imported using their full address and that should be downloaded before their first use.
One such example is github.com/matryer/is, which is stored in GitHub.

Packages are mainly used for grouping related functions, variables, and constants so that
you can transfer them easily and use them in your own Go programs. Note that apart from
the main package, Go packages are not autonomous programs and cannot be compiled into
executable files. This means that they need to be called directly or indirectly from a main
package in order to be used. As a result, if you try to execute a Go package as if it is an
autonomous program, you will be disappointed:
`
```go
$ go run aPackage.go
go run: cannot run non-main package
```

任何内容在Go语言中交付都是以packages的形式。Go package是一个用package关键字开头，后面跟着包名的源文件。一些packages也有结构。例如net包有一系列的子目录，http、mail、rpc、smtp、textproto、url。这些包可以用 `net/http, net/mail, net/rpc, net/smtp, net/textproto, net/url` 的语法形式单独使用。

为了和Go标准库做分离，存在一些能够使用全路径导入的外部包，在第一次使用之前会被下载。如`github.com/matryer/is`，是一个Github仓库。

Packages主要使用于将函数、变量、 常量分组。为的是在使用自己的Go程序时迁移这些分组更加便捷。注意，除了主要的main package，其他Go packages 程序不能够被编译到可执行文件。这意味着它们需要被main package直接或者间接的引用。如果你执行一个自己的go package（不是main package）。出现如下错误：

```go
$ go run aPackage.go
go run: cannot run non-main package
```
